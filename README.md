DESCRIPTION OF TASK : Sentiment Analysis Project Using Machine Learning

In this project, I built a sentiment analysis model using machine learning to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. I used the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification and performed data preprocessing with techniques like stopword removal and text cleaning. The dataset used is from NLTKâ€™s movie review corpus. I then trained the model on a training set and evaluated its accuracy on a test set. The model achieved a good performance with 81% accuracy. I also tested the model with my own movie reviews to predict sentiments. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in text classification tasks.
